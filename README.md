# Website Optimization project
====================================
## How I set up the working environment for this project:
  1. Cloned original repo from https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio
  2. Opted for GitHub pages in order to host the web site for analysis: https://oearikan.github.io/website-optimization-project/ (I find the incorporation of extra tools such as ngrok, grunt, gulp etc... distracting while I'm already struggling to learn a new skill, so I avoid them whenever I can. However, I appreciate that time will come that I'll find them handy. Just taking my time)

### PageSpeed Insights Summary
 - Initial Score => Mobile: Poor(27/100); Desktop: Poor(29/100)
 - Run 'Load performance profiling': pizzeria.jpg takes 11.88s to load which is unacceptable(360x270), (native: 2048 x 1536; don't need this big. So replaced)

### Objective 1: Score >90 for both mobile and desktop on PageInsights

### Objective 2.1: Score 60 fps

### Objective 2.2: Score <5ms for slider action
